            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><strong>OTTAWA —Like the number of double-doubles sold at Tim Hortons, the variety of weight-loss schemes that have come and gone over the decades is immense. One still commanding attention, thanks in no small part to the attention given it by television’s favourite medical man Dr. Oz, is green coffee bean extract.
</strong><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>As reported on Oz’s show, a study published last year in Diabetes Metabolic Syndrome and Obesity involved 16 overweight subjects who took the extract in pill form for 22 weeks. Although their daily calorie intake far exceeded what they were burning, the study found they lost an average of 17 pounds or about 10 per cent of their weight.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Dr. Joe Vinson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Scranton in Pennsylvania, led the study. He credited chlorogenic acid, which vanishes when the beans are roasted, with promoting weight loss, in part by stopping fat absorption by the body.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>In an email, Vinson says there have been two other studies of the same product: one in France and one in South Korea. They both showed weight loss, although doses of the extract and weight loss were both smaller.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>The Dr. Oz Show ran its own experiment and reported an average weight loss of two pounds over two weeks for those who took the extract compared to one pound for those who took a placebo.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Although the extract is very bitter, “there are no published side effects,” writes Vinson. “I took it myself for a month to see if I had any side effects, but there were none.”
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Richard Mathias, professor emeritus in the University of British Columbia’s School of Population and Public Health, is not sold.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>“This is a scam,” he says. “It’s been done many, many times with a variety of products. It’s usually some kind of miracle berry that’s been discovered in the Amazon jungle and cures anything.”
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>(Coincidentally, a recent half-page newspaper ad — and such things don’t come cheaply — touts the wonders of a “Fat Fighting Smoothie” whose key ingredient comes from the Himalayan Perennial Fruit.)
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Mathias says Vinson’s study used a crossover design, a simplistic method compared to the “gold standard” of randomized control trials, and says Vinson didn’t actually lead the study, but simply wrote up the results.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Others have criticized the study for the small number of participants or worried that coffee beans contain many chemicals — some good and some harmful, in concentrations dense enough to present health risks. Rena Mendelson, a professor of nutrition at Ryerson University, says, “Dr. Oz has millions and millions of followers. All he has to do is promote something and it goes wild.”
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>The pharmacological industry, Mendelson continues, has spent a king’s ransom developing weight- loss drugs and still not come up with a long-lasting solution. The drugs may not work for everyone, they can have unpleasant side effects and people tend to regain the weight when they stop taking the drugs.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>“The issue of weight management is so complicated,” says Mendelson. “It’s not just eating less and doing more. The (social) environment we live in totally conspires against healthy living. Some bodies burn calories at different rates and appetite hormones can’t be turned off cognitively.”
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>If you’re serious about weight loss, she suggests you start by talking to your family doctor or a dietitian (for a list of local dietitians, visit dietitians.ca). Those professionals are usually connected with health teams who can help you with everything from menu planning to exercise programs.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>With the holiday season around the corner, you may also want to see the Dietitians of Canada’s common-sense approach to eating well: How Can I Survive the Holiday Season? at dietitians.ca.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Green coffee bean extract is, as UBC’s Mathias points out, not the only products making big claims. Green tea and bitter orange have supposed weight-loss benefits, but mayoclinic.com notes that they “have minimal or no evidence of effectiveness and may cause insomnia, dizziness and other side effects.”
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>The site adds that dietary supplements and weight-loss aids aren’t subject to the same rigorous standards as prescription drugs.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Health Canada warns about uncertified natural products, including the potential dangers of mixing them with medications and even with some foods.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>As for buying such products in the Wild West that is the Internet, one site (greencoffeebeanx.net), without referencing a single study as proof, claims that green coffee bean extract will not only help you shed pounds, but also aid in preventing certain types of cancer, cardiovascular disease and Type 2 diabetes.”
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>It’s worth noting that the Mayo Clinic’s website also holds little truck with ear stapling as a weight-loss strategy. Seems that proponents of the practice — apparently they’re out there — believe that if acupuncture can suppress appetite by stimulating certain parts of the ear using needles for a short period of time, small surgical staples, left in place for weeks or even months, will do a bang-up job of reducing appetite. They may also reduce your health by infecting you, notes the website.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>The real culprit in weight gain, says Mathias, is not fat in our diet, but the added sugar in everything from breakfast cereals to desserts. Trying to wean yourself off the stuff is tough.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>So is dieting, and if it’s of the yo-yo variety where you shed, gain and re-loose weight in an endless cycle, it can be dangerous, as well, he says. That’s because it may result in depression, heart disease and liver problems.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>Mendelson says that people starting any regimen may lose weight initially but soon hit a plateau and, in the long run, are unlikely to keep the weight off. Over-the-counter products tend to be a “distraction” in the battle of the bulge.
</strong></div><div><strong>
</strong></div><div><strong>However, they are almost irresistible, she says, because they make weight loss sound easy. In fact, “it’s all hard work.”</strong></div></div>
